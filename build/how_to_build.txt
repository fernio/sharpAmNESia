On Linux, you have to have CMake installed. Just open a terminal and type

cmake ..

on the "build" folder of the project. After that, just type

make

to compile the emulator and all the tests. To run these tests, type

ctest

or, if you want to see the output of failing tests, type

ctest --output-on-failure
